# Advanced JS & Intro to React: PokeAPI Integration

This application allows users to enter a pokemon name or number, and relevant information about said pokemon will pop up. The information contains a sprite, name, id, abilities, base experience, and types. There is also error handling built-in, as a message will pop up if an incorrect input is provided.
